= Building a Cloud-ready Microservice

This repository contains a link:demo-script.adoc[script] for demonstrating the construction of a REST microservice using Spring Boot, Spring Data, and Spring Cloud, and deploying the microservice to Cloud Foundry.
 
The repository also contains the completed example, ready for deployment to Cloud Foundry. 

To build and deploy the completed application, you will need to: 
 
* install http://www.gradle.org/installation[Gradle]
* install the http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/installcf/install-go-cli.html[Cloud Foundry CLI]
* use the Cloud Foundry CLI to http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/installcf/whats-new-v6.html#login[log into your Cloud Foundry system]

Once these prerequisites are met, you can follow these steps to build and deploy the microservice to Cloud Foundry:

[source,bash]
----
$ gradle assemble
$ cf create-service p-mysql 100mb-dev cities-db
$ cf push --random-route
----

See the link:demo-script.adoc[script] for additional information on using and testing the microservice.
